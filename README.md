# SkillCraftTechnology-WebDev-Task2
##🚀 Web Development Intern | Task 2 Completed at SkillCraft Technology 🚀

I'm excited to share the second task of my internship journey at SkillCraft Technology!
In this task, I designed and developed an interactive and user-friendly Stopwatch Web Application ⏱️ using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

✨ Key Features:

-> Start, pause, and reset functionality

-> Lap time tracking and display

-> Accurate time interval measurement

-> Clean, responsive UI for a smooth user experience

This project enhanced my understanding of JavaScript event handling, DOM manipulation, and UI design principles. It’s been a great learning experience, and I’m looking forward to building more dynamic and user-focused applications.
